<!-- To Connect to database: open MongoDB Compass, connect -->
<!-- I want to use the database to store the progress of the user: the topics they have completed, the skills associated with that topic, their character name, description, items, their level, their subjects they're currently on and the progress

Major Topics:
Math
Operations
Regrouping
Factors of 10
Place Value

Drawing
Shape
Form
Value
Perspective
Movement
Space
Line
Color
Proportion
Medium

Science

I want the form to look like the progress form but each field is editable, the topics are movable and sortable, the progress bar for each can be increased/decreased, topics can be moved into the mastered section and when they are the star icon pops up

Make form
  Box with two columns, 7-5

Make fields editable
Make items movable
(**tested mapping draggable fields, may used map with only 2nd column or remove the map and import the draggable directly into the component)
